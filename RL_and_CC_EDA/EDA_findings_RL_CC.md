## Rule of Law and Control Of Corruption

The datasets provided by the World Bank Group are percentile rankings used in this research to assess political instability across countries. These rankings allow for a standardized comparison between nations and serve as proxy indicators for deeper systemic issues that contribute to terrorism.

- **Rule of Law Percentile**
    This metric reflects the extent to which individuals and institutions have confidence in and abide by the rules of society. It measures factors such as the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. A lower percentile ranking indicates a weaker rule of law, suggesting a higher potential for social disorder and governance failure.

- **Control of Corruption Percentile**
    This ranking captures perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as "capture" of the state by elites and private interests. A lower percentile ranking indicates higher levels of corruption, which can undermine state legitimacy and fuel grievances that terrorist groups exploit.

Political instability is, by nature, a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. Reducing it solely to two metrics would oversimplify its nature without appropriate contextualization. Nevertheless, within the scope of this research—focused specifically on terrorism—the assumption is made that corruption and the absence of effective law enforcement are among the most predominant factors driving politically motivated violence.

By focusing on these two metrics, this research seeks to highlight the governance failures that create fertile ground for terrorism, while acknowledging that a comprehensive understanding of political instability would require broader analysis.
